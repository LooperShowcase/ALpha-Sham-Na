      Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming
      service. The service primarily distributes original and acquired films and
      television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally
      in multiple languages.[6] Launched on January 16, 2007, nearly a decade
      after Netflix, Inc. began its pioneering DVD‑by‑mail movie rental service,
      Netflix is the most-subscribed video on demand streaming media service,
      with 260.28 million paid memberships in more than 190 countries as of
      January 2024.[5][7] By 2022, "Netflix Original" productions accounted for
      half of its library in the United States and the namesake company had
      ventured into other categories, such as video game publishing of mobile
      games via its flagship service. As of October 2023, Netflix is the 24th
      most-visited website in the world with 23.66% of its traffic coming from
      the United States, followed by the United Kingdom at 5.84% and Brazil at
      5.64%.[8][9] <br />Netflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings
      on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California. Hastings, a computer
      scientist and mathematician, was a co-founder of Pure Software, which was
      acquired by Rational Software that year for $750 million, the then biggest
      acquisition in Silicon Valley history.[10] Randolph had worked as a
      marketing director for Pure Software after Pure Atria acquired a company
      where Randolph worked. He was previously a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a
      computer mail-order company, as well as vice president of marketing for
      Borland.[11][12] Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix
      while carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz, California, and Pure
      Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale.[13] Patty McCord, later head of human
      resources at Netflix, was also in the carpool group.[14] Randolph admired
      Amazon and wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over
      the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and Randolph considered and
      rejected selling and renting VHS as too expensive to stock and too
      delicate to ship.[11] When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the
      United States in early 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting
      DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa
      Cruz.[11] When the disc arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16
      billion Home-video sales and rental industry.[11][13] Hastings is often
      quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a
      Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13.[13]
      Hastings invested $2.5 million into Netflix from the sale of Pure
      Atria.[15][13] Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website
      with 30 employees and 925 titles available—nearly all DVDs
      published.[13][16][17] Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos, where
      Amazon offered to acquire Netflix for between $14 and $16 million. Fearing
      competition from Amazon, Randolph at first thought the offer was fair, but
      Hastings, who owned 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride
      home.[18][19
